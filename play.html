        <h4>THE EXCHANGE BY ALTHEA THURSTON</h4>
        <p>IMP. [_Throws down his pen, chuckles, and half standing on the rungs of
            his chair and balancing himself against his desk, surveys the ledger._]
            Your honor, I've all the miseries listed to date and a fine lot there is
            to choose from. Everything from bunions to old wives for exchange.</p>
        <p>JUDGE. [_Scowls and impatiently taps the letter he is reading._] Here is
            another one. A woman suspects her husband of a misalliance. Wants to
            catch him, but is so crippled with rheumatism she can't get about. Wants
            us to exchange her rheumatism for something that won't interfere with
            either her walking or her eyesight.</p>
        <p>IMP. [_Referring to the ledger and running his finger along the lines._]
            We have a defective heart or a lazy liver that we could give her.</p>
        <p>JUDGE. [_Irritably tossing the letter over to_ IMP.] She would not be
            satisfied. People never are. They always want to change their miseries,
            but never their vices. Each thinks his own cross heavier than others
            have to bear, but he is very willing to make light of his own weaknesses
            and shortcomings. He thinks they are not half so bad as his neighbor's.
            I have tried for years to aid distressed humanity, but I can't satisfy
            them. I am growing tired of it all, Imp. People need a lesson and
            they're going to get it, too. I am going to----
            
                 [_Knock is heard at the street door._ JUDGE _sighs, turns to his
                 desk and begins to write_. IMP _sweeps the litter of papers on his
                 desk into a drawer, closes ledger, and goes to answer knock_.</p> 
        <p>IMP. Here comes another misery.
            [IMP _opens the door to admit the_ POOR MAN, _who is very shabbily
                 dressed. He hesitates, looks around the room as if he were in the
                 wrong place, and then addresses_ IMP _in a loud whisper_.</p>
        <p>POOR MAN. [_Indicating the_ JUDGE _with a motion of his head_.] Is that
            him?</p>
        <p>    
            IMP. [_Whispering loudly his reply._] Yes, that is his honor.
